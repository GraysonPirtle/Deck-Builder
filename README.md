# Deck-Building-Program
A simple program that's used to calculate the probability of drawing cards from a deck.

You should see some GUI that allows you to punch in whatever parameters you want. Since I programmed it for Pokemon, I'll use that as an example. Let's say you really want to draw into at least one energy card in your opening hand, and you have 9 in your deck. Then you would input 60, 7, 9, 1, 0. The last value should change if you want the exact amount of cards or not.
